# Seth Gerou - GPS1.1

*What was I struggling with (about Git) prior to the GPS?*

**How a repo is shared between collaborators.**

*What concepts were clarified?*

**Collaboration is clearer to me now, but I still feel like I barely know how this works.**

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

** Asked the guide about the difference between fetch and pull.
Asked pair about creating pull requests on someone else's repo. **

*What still confuses you about git?*

** Still a little fuzzy about how to review a pull request and decide whether to merge it. **

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

** Good!  It was fun to think through the challenge with someone else - it's a very different experience than working independently.  I have some frustrating connectivity issues - will see what I can do to resolve - pairing sessions will be better with improved connection. **
