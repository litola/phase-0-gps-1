* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

  I was having some issues with the fetch and merge, and pull differences.
  I think now everything its clear.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

  We talked about our first GPS and how we suppose to interact in real projects as
  driver and navigator.About git Gary explained us the difference between fetch and pull

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

  I asked questions about the work flow from github and references about names,
  or commands that we needed to do.

* **What still confuses you about Git?**

  Git I think its big and until we run into another problem we'll be looking for
  more answers, right now the basic parts I think I have them ready to keep practicing.

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

  In my opinion everything run good and smooth, some minor lag problems but at
  the end everything worked fine, and I think it was good it said to change
  Driver and Navigator because time fly and when you check the clock it already
  passed the hour.
